Task 2 :   Write a method that can check if a number is Armstrong number

                Note: if I have a 3-digit number then each of the digits is raised to the power of three and added to obtain a number. If the number obtained equals the original number then, we call that armstrong number.

                Armstrong numbers are     === 153 370 371 407 === for 3 digits
